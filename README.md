# Basic Portfolio

This is a simplified vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript version of my [portfolio](https://pdrmenezes.com).

Just as a reminder that we should probably avoid adding complexity where it isn't needed.

### ✨ Features (I guess)

- ✅ No frameworks or build systems
- ✅ System fonts only (Apple system fonts, Segoe UI, etc.)
- ✅ Basic animation effects with View Transitions and CSS transitions
- ✅ Javascript only used on View Transitions and to copy the email to the clipboard
- ✅ 79kb total size
